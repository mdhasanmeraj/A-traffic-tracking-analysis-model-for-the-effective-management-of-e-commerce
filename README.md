The project aims to design a web traffic tracking and analysis system to provide insights into user behavior on e-commerce websites. This system will help merchants understand both the general performance of their website and more specific user interactions, helping to shape marketing and engagement strategies. This model is built by using MERN stack technology.
This repository contains the updated and complete version of the Traffic Tracking Analysis Model project, including the final report and all implementation details.
